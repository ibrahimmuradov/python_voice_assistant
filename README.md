# Python Vioce Assistant

You can use the vioce assistant project I made according to your wishes.

## Description

I made a simple voice assistant project with Python. You can speak with the sentences written in the words.py file. 
The assistant will respond to the sentence you say to him. You can customize the sentences you want in English by adding them to the words.py file.
